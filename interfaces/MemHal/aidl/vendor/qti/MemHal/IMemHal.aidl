*  Currently we are supporting three requests:
*     VENDOR_SET_MEMORY_NODE_Request :Will be used to set value of different memory related node. We need to provide opcode for node and the value we need to set.
*     VENDOR_FREE_MEMORY_REQUEST :Will be used to free the requested type of memory. We need to provide opcode for memory type and amount of memory to be freed.
*     VENDOR_BOOST_MODE_REQUEST :Will be used to set device in boost mode. We will limit the concurrency to maintain more free memory.
*
*  It will take three arguments:
*     in_list: int vector, first index will have request type(defined above), followed by the arguments corresponding to request.
*     req_details: int vector, contains pid and tid of calling process. Can be expanded on need.
*
*  Return type: int , Return request handle on success else failure.

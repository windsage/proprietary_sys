/**
 * @file check.h
 *
 * This file declares macros for dealing with errors.  Goals include:
 *
 *   - Making it easier to write code that checks errors correctly.
 *
 *   - Improving the readability of code.
 *
 *   - Encouraging a more systematic approach to error handling.
 *
 * Be advised that these macros embed control flow, so users should
 * take care to read and understand each of these.
 *
 * A convention encouraged here is that functions return integer error
 * codes, where 0 indicates success and non-zero values indicate failure.
 * The CHECK() and GUARD() encapsulate the following patterns, and add some
 * additional functionality that is discussed below.
 *
 *    CHECK(is_okay);    -->    if (! is_okay) {
 *                                 return 1;
 *                              }
 *
 *
 *    GUARD(status);     -->    if (status != 0) {
 *                                 return status;
 *                              }
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *    ...
 *    CHECK(a < max);
 *    CHECK(b < max);
 *    GUARD(computeValue(array[a], array[b]));
 *    ...
 *
 * Meaningful Errors and Diagnostics
 *
 * There is no need to define a distinct error code for every place in the
 * code where validation occurs.  While this can help the author with "in
 * the field" diagnostics, it pollutes the interface specification with
 * implementation details that are meaningless to the caller of the API.
 * Instead, to provide even better diagnostics and to avoid such pollution,
 * we log each CHECK failure.
 *
 * CHECK() should be used for exceptional conditions: those that are not
 * encountered when all software in the system is functioning properly. For
 * example, most bounds-checking falls into this category.
 *
 * GUARD() does not log additional information.  It re-reports a previously-
 * detected error condition.  An analogy can be made to exception handling
 * in languages like C++ and Java: a CHECK failure "throws", and GUARD will
 * "re-throw".
 *
 * CHECK_LOG() logs the file and line at which CHECK was called.  In unit
 * test builds, these are printed to stdout.
 *
 * Cleanup
 *
 * Some functions allocate and free resources during a call.  In these
 * cases, a "return" in between the allocation and the free could lead to a
 * leak.  One of the following approaches are recommended:
 *
 *  1. Store the pointer to the resource in an object (as a "member
 *     variable").  This allows the resource to be freed later when the
 *     destructor ("deinit" or "free" function) is called.
 *
 *  2. Ensure that no CHECK, GUARD, or return statements occur between the
 *     allocation and the free.  For example, the code could copy out values
 *     that can then be validated after the free.
 *
 *  3. Use the "goto bail" convention.
 *
 *     Free all resources in only one place, at the bottom of the function,
 *     following a label named "bail".  At the top of the function,
 *     intialize variables that hold resource pointers to NULL.  Within the
 *     body of the function, use "goto bail" whenever an error is
 *     encountered.  Since both success and failure cases will fall through
 *     to "bail", initialize the return code to "failure".
 *
 *     Instead of CHECK() use CHECK_ELSE(..., goto bail).
 *
 *     Instead of GUARD() use `if (status) goto bail;`.
